/*  
Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Bird, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.

This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.

A better way is to use the prototype of Bird. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Bird. Here's how to add numLegs to the Bird prototype:
*/

// ! Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;



function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

console.log(Dog.numLegs)
